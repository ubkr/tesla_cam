- Include GPS coordinates, speed, autopilot status, etc.
- Option to export entire session or time range

**Export Format Examples**:
```csv
timestamp,speed_mph,gear,autopilot,latitude,longitude,heading
0.000,0,P,OFF,37.773972,-122.431297,45.0
0.033,0,P,OFF,37.773972,-122.431297,45.0
```

- Customizable marker types and thresholds

**Visual Design**:
```
Timeline: ═══════════════════════════════════════
Speed:    ▁▂▃▅▆▇█▇▆▅▄▃▂▁ (miniature graph)
Events:      🛑      ⚡        🔄    (icons)
```

**Benefits**:

- `[/]`: Slow down/speed up playback
- `?`: Show keyboard shortcut help

**Implementation**:
- Add keyboard event listeners
- Show on-screen help overlay (press `?`)
- Don't interfere with native video controls

---

#### 6. Dark Mode Theme
**Status**: Planned
**Complexity**: Low
**Description**: Dark theme for comfortable viewing
- Toggle between light/dark themes

- Ensure map tiles work well in dark mode

---

#### 7. Event Detection
**Status**: Planned
**Complexity**: Medium
**Description**: Automatic detection of driving events
- Hard braking (sudden deceleration)
- Sharp turns (high steering angle + speed)
- Autopilot engagement/disengagement
